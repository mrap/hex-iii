description: >-
  Selects how functions are invoked: synchronous result-returning calls,
  fire-and-forget void dispatches, or durable `TriggerAction.Enqueue({ queue })`
  background jobs. Use whenever a handler should not block the caller, work
  should run later or reliably with retries, a request should return quickly,
  or an agent must choose between inline RPC, optional side effects, and queued
  async processing.

# Trigger Actions

Comparable to: RPC vs message queue vs fire-and-forget patterns

## Key Concepts

Use the concepts below when they fit the task. Not every invocation needs all three modes.

- **Synchronous** (default): caller blocks until the function returns a result or times out
- **Void** (`TriggerAction.Void()`): fire-and-forget dispatch, returns immediately, no retry guarantees
- **Enqueue** (`TriggerAction.Enqueue({ queue })`): routes through a named queue with automatic retries and backoff, returns a `messageReceiptId`
- Decision guide: need the result? use sync. Must complete reliably? use enqueue. Optional side effect? use void.

## Architecture

The caller invokes `trigger()` with an optional action parameter. Synchronous mode waits for the handler result. Void mode dispatches and returns immediately. Enqueue mode places the payload on a named queue where a consumer processes it with retry guarantees.

## iii Primitives Used

| Primitive                                                    | Purpose                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `trigger({ function_id, payload })`                          | Synchronous invocation, blocks for result      |
| `trigger({ ..., action: TriggerAction.Void() })`             | Fire-and-forget, returns immediately           |
| `trigger({ ..., action: TriggerAction.Enqueue({ queue }) })` | Durable async via named queue, returns receipt |
| `iii trigger --function-id=ID --payload=JSON`                | CLI trigger (part of the engine binary)        |
| `--timeout-ms`                                               | CLI flag to set trigger timeout (default 30s)  |

## Code Examples

TypeScript:

```typescript
import { TriggerAction } from "iii-sdk";

const validated = await iii.trigger({
  function_id: "orders::validate",
  payload: order,
});

await iii.trigger({
  function_id: "analytics::track",
  payload: { event: "order_created", orderId: order.id },
  action: TriggerAction.Void(),
});

const queued = await iii.trigger({
  function_id: "orders::charge",
  payload: validated,
  action: TriggerAction.Enqueue({ queue: "payments" }),
});
```

Python:

```python
validated = iii.trigger({"function_id": "orders::validate", "payload": order})

iii.trigger({
    "function_id": "analytics::track",
    "payload": {"event": "order_created", "orderId": order["id"]},
    "action": {"type": "void"},
})

queued = iii.trigger({
    "function_id": "orders::charge",
    "payload": validated,
    "action": {"type": "enqueue", "queue": "payments"},
})
```

Rust:

```rust
use iii_sdk::{TriggerAction, TriggerRequest};
use serde_json::json;

let validated = iii.trigger(TriggerRequest::new("orders::validate", order)).await?;

iii.trigger(TriggerRequest {
    function_id: "analytics::track".into(),
    payload: json!({ "event": "order_created" }),
    action: Some(TriggerAction::Void),
    timeout_ms: None,
}).await?;

let queued = iii.trigger(TriggerRequest {
    function_id: "orders::charge".into(),
    payload: validated,
    action: Some(TriggerAction::Enqueue { queue: "payments".into() }),
    timeout_ms: None,
}).await?;
```

## Common Patterns

Code using this pattern commonly includes, when relevant:

- `await iii.trigger({ function_id: 'users::get', payload: { id } })` — sync, get result directly
- `iii.trigger({ function_id: 'analytics::track', payload: event, action: TriggerAction.Void() })` — fire-and-forget
- `iii.trigger({ function_id: 'orders::process', payload: order, action: TriggerAction.Enqueue({ queue: 'payments' }) })` — durable enqueue
- Sync returns the function result directly
- Void returns `undefined` in Node/browser, `None` in Python, and `Value::Null` in Rust
- Enqueue returns `{ messageReceiptId: string }` as JSON; Rust may deserialize to `EnqueueResult { message_receipt_id }`
- `iii trigger --function-id='users::get' --payload='{"id":"123"}'` — invoke via CLI
- `iii trigger --function-id='users::get' --payload='{"id":"123"}' --timeout-ms=5000` — with custom timeout

## Timeout and Error Behavior

- The default invocation timeout is 30 seconds unless overridden by SDK init options or per-call `timeoutMs` / `timeout_ms`.
- Sync invocation surfaces handler errors, engine errors, RBAC denial, and timeout errors to the caller.
- Void invocation only confirms dispatch; it does not return handler results and does not give retry guarantees.
- Enqueue confirms message acceptance. Handler failures are retried according to queue configuration and may later land in a dead letter queue.
- Use `iii-error-handling` for `FORBIDDEN`, `TIMEOUT`, `function_not_found`, `function_not_invokable`, `invocation_failed`, and `invocation_stopped`.

## Adapting This Pattern

Use the adaptations below when they apply to the task.

- Default to synchronous when the caller needs the result to proceed
- Use void for logging, analytics, or any side effect where failure is acceptable
- Use enqueue for anything that must complete reliably — payments, emails, notifications
- Combine modes in a single handler: sync call for validation, then enqueue for processing
- Named queues let you configure retries and concurrency per workload type

## Pattern Boundaries

- For queue configuration (retries, concurrency, FIFO ordering), prefer `iii-engine-config`.
- For queue execution and DLQ behavior, use the queue worker docs under `engine/src/workers/**/skills`.
- For error handling, prefer `iii-error-handling`.
- For function registration and trigger binding, prefer `iii-functions-and-triggers`.
- Stay with `iii-trigger-actions` when the primary problem is choosing the right invocation mode.

## When to Use

- Use this skill when the task is primarily about `iii-trigger-actions` in the iii engine.
- Use this skill even when the request does not say "enqueue" if work is slow, retryable, reliable, or should continue after the caller returns.

## Boundaries

- Never use this skill as a generic fallback for unrelated tasks.
- You must not apply this skill when a more specific iii skill is a better fit.
- Always verify environment and safety constraints before applying examples from this skill.
