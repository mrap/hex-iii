//! Guest-side dispatcher for the `iii.exec` virtio-console shell channel.
//!
//! Runs on a dedicated thread alongside the existing supervisor control
//! thread. Reads multiplexed frames from the port (one stream, many
//! concurrent sessions distinguished by `corr_id`), spawns child
//! processes in pipe mode or TTY mode, and streams their output back
//! on the same port. TTY mode allocates a pseudo-terminal via
//! `openpty(3)` and points the child's stdin/stdout/stderr at the
//! slave so `isatty(3)` says yes — needed for interactive shells,
//! line editors, and any program that toggles buffering based on
//! terminal detection.
//!
//! Threading model:
//!
//! - One reader thread (the `run` call) owns the port read half and
//!   dispatches incoming frames.
//! - Per-session stdout/stderr reader threads stream child output
//!   back through the shared writer.
//! - Per-session wait thread observes child exit and sends `Exited`
//!   with the terminal flag.
//! - All writes funnel through `Arc<Mutex<File>>` so frames don't
//!   interleave on the wire.
//!
//! Signals, stdin EOF, and cleanup are all routed by `corr_id` via the
//! shared `SessionRegistry`; session entries are removed after the
//! wait thread has emitted the terminal `Exited` frame.
